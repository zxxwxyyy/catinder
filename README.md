Catinder is a unique adoption web-app designed to help homeless cats find their forever homes. Built using Petfinder's API and p5.js. This Creative Coding Midterm Project offers a fresh and fun approach to pet adoption, inspired by the popular dating app Tinder. The app features a simple, intuitive interface that allows users to swipe through a selection of adorable cats and kittens, each with their own unique profiles. With built-in buttons, users can easily browse through the cats, open the adoption link, or archive a cat for later. Whether you're a cat lover looking for a new furry friend or simply seeking a fun and engaging app experience, Catinder is the perfect choice.
