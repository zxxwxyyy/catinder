This is a NYU IDM Creative Coding midterm project. 
For my midterm, I am thinking of exploring more API by creating a pet adoption APP. I am a cat person, I knew that there are still many homeless pets around the world, and I believe adoption is meaningful and can actually help. They are waiting for a warm home and a great person who will spend time with them for the rest of their life. So I decided to create a mini-app to help.Â
